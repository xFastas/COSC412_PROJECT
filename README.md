**Overview**

This repository serves as to house the group code for our COSC 412 Group Project, where we aim to create a web application to help users find recipes for dishes using ingredients already found within their home.
Due to the time constraints of this project, users will have a pre-defined variety of common household ingredients in which they can choose from. After selecting ingredients, code will be sent to chatGPT's api to dynamically produce unique recipes for the user.
